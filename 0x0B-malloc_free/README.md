0x0B.C - malloc, free
malloc() is a dynamic memory allocation function used in C to allocate memory to a program at runtime from the heap. The function returns a pointer to the allocated memory/space.

After use, the allocated memory needs to be returned to the operating system for use. This is achieved through the use of the free() function which frees the allocated memory and returs it to the OS.
