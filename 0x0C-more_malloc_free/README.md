0x0C - More malloc, free

This project involves the advanced use of the malloc and free dynamic memory allocation functions in C. 

The projects introduce calloc, realloc and exit functions. 

The difference between malloc and calloc is that malloc does not initialize the contents of the allocated memory/space with any value. Calloc on the other hand initializes the memory with zeros. 

Because calloc initializes the memory to zero, it is a bit slower than malloc.

The realloc function is used to allocate a new memory size to a previously allocated memory by malloc or calloc.
